/* p4_5.c C library Console I/O using USART2 at 9600 Baud
 *
 * This program demonstrates the use of C library console I/O.
 * The functions fputc() and fgetc() are implemented using
 * USART2_write() and USART2_read() for character I/O.
 * In the fgetc(), the received character is echoed and if a '\r'
 * is received, a pair of '\r', '\n' is echoed.
 * In fputc() and fgetc(), the file descripter is not checked. All
 * file I/O's are directed to the console.
 *
 * By default, the clock is running at 16 MHz.
 * The USART is configured for 9600 Baud.
 * PA2 - USART2 TX (AF7)
 * PA3 - USART2 RX (AF7)
 * Use Tera Term on the host PC to send keystrokes and observe the display
 * of the characters echoed.
 *
 * This program was tested with Keil uVision v5.24a with DFP v2.11.0
